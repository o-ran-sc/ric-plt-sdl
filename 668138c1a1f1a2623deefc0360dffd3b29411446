      "message": "Above mentioned environment variables are not used in RIC currently. Instead there is `conf/ric_dbaas.json` configuration file, which has hard coded \"dbaas\" Kubernetes service name configured as database address (actual address comes from DNS in connection setup phase).\n\nThis is just a temporary solution for current (simple/initial) dbaas deployment. There is plan to replace static JSON configuration with configmap later, when dbaas provides database address in configmap.\n\nSentinel support will be added later as a separate merge.\n\nIs it OK to go with current temporary solution in the mean time ?",

      "message": "As discussed offline, I have been testing against outdated dbaas Helm chart (the one which is found from \u0027ric-plt/dbaas\u0027 repo, correct one is inside \u0027it/dep\u0027 repo).\n\nIn current dbaas deployment above mentioned service name is updated, and not something that is easy to be hard coded inside SDL. Also environment variables has been changed so that they use service name internally.\n\nIt is better to switch to use environment variables, as you proposed.\n\nGood finding, thanks!",
