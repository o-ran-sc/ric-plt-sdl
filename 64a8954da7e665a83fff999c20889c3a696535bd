      "message": "This is good. \n\nShould we additionally mention that any error (database connection loss/switchover) will return the operation immediately with failure or would that be assumed?\n\nShould we also suggest the minimum value to use? \n\nAnd where this is good for any SDL operation after database has come back up (operation could hang for minutes due to TCP buffering). Should there still be own API for initial use? Meaning you start your program and then you first wait DB in lets say 10s wait loops writing log every time that there is no DB. And once you have the initial connection, then the timeout is set to something lower like 1s?",
